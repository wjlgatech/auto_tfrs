# fast_tfrs

fast_tfrs is a easy-to-use, easy-to-build scalable recommendation engine based on TFRS.


## Features Built
- To automatically identify cnt, cat (str_, int_), txt, img columns of a df, built split_cnt_cat_txt_img()

- preprocess and encode cnt_cols

- preprocess and encode cat_cols

- preprocess and encode txt_cols

- preprocess and encode img_cols

- To integrate cnt, cat, txt, img info effectively, add wide-cross-deep layer

- To built 2-tower structure for User and Item, respectively

- To automatically do hyperparameter tuning, built keras tuning includes RandomSearch, Bayesian, Hyperband

## Features to Build
- To achieve model-specific feature selection, build grn-vsn layer

- To understand the model on both population-level and individual-sample-level, add SHAP method into the class
